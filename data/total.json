The difference in pressure between the inside and the outside can thus be determined by observation of the difference $h$ in heights of the two columns in the manometer. The bottle is filled with the gas to be investigated, at a very slight excess pressure over the outside atmospheric pressure. The bottle is left in peace (with the tap closed) until the temperature of the gas in the bottle is the same as the outside temperature in the room. Let the reading of the manometer be $h_{i}$. The tap $H$ is then opened for a very short time, just sufficient for the internal pressure to become equal to the atmospheric pressure (in which case the manometer reads $h=0$ ). With the tap closed the bottle is left in peace for a while, until the inside temperature has become equal to the outside temperature. Let the final reading of the manometer be $h$. From the values of $h_{i}$ and $h_{f}$ it is possible to find $C_{p} / C_{v}$. Suppose that the gas in question is oxygen.

We also assume that the nucleus, of charge $Z e$, remains fixed in space (i.e., its mass is assumed infinite). Let $\\rho(\\mathbf{x})$ denote the charge density in the nucleus. The charge distribution is assumed to be spherically symmetric but otherwise arbitrary.\n\nLet $f_{c}\\left(\\mathbf{p}_{i}, \\mathbf{p}_{f}\\right)$, where $\\mathbf{p}_{i}$ is the initial and $\\mathbf{p}_{f}$ the final momentum, be the scattering amplitude in the first Born approximation for the scattering of an electron from a point-nucleus of charge $Z e$.

After 10 minutes, the current in the heater is increased and the balance readings are taken for a further 12 minutes. The variation with time of the balance reading is shown in Fig. 3.2. The readings of the ammeter and of the voltmeter are shown in Fig. 3.3. Determine a value for the specific latent heat of fusion $L$ of ice.",
