  When drawing images with Canvas, ensure the relative positions and connections of each component, such as the direction of forces, velocity direction, series-parallel relationships in circuits, start and end points of connections, start and end points of angle arcs, direction, etc.
  In the drawing code, objects must not overlap, clip through each other, or float in the air. The schematic must conform to the relative positional relationships in physics. Checking the change positions of curves and the slope of straight lines at specific positions in the coordinate system is very important, as different slopes represent completely different content. The coordinate axes, positions of curve/line segment mutations, and slopes are crucial. The amplitude and frequency of trigonometric functions are also crucial and must be strictly consistent.
  When handwritten characters in the image are difficult to recognize, determine accurate symbols based on the specific problem situation and common symbols in physics, such as positive and negative pole positions, resistor voltage positions and values, angle symbols or values, etc. The position and subscript of symbols are crucial and must be accurate.
  Question: {question}
  Image type: {img_type}

  Based on the input image and its corresponding physics problem, analyze the image in detail and generate HTML Canvas code to redraw the image. The code needs to be wrapped in ```html ```.

identical: |
  The first image is the original image, and the second image is the image generated by the drawing code. Compare these two schematic diagrams in detail and determine if they are identical.
  Compare the relative positional relationships of elements in the two images, check that the start and end points of angle arcs and direction follow physical meaning, and ensure symbol descriptions are consistent.
  
  Output requirements: If the two images are consistent, identical, or completely consistent in content, only output "identical"; otherwise only output "not identical". Strictly output "identical" or "not identical". Do not include any extra content.
