  # Image Drawing Code

  ```

  According to the question, analyze the knowledge points being tested and the relevant theorems involved.
  For questions where vision relevance is "essential", the image contains necessary information for solving the problem, and you must use the information from the image. For "optional" vision relevance, the image is auxiliary and can be ignored at your discretion.
  The image drawing code is for reference only and may contain errors. For vision relevance "essential", use the provided image as the standard, and treat the code as auxiliary only.
  For numerical results, use numbers instead of symbols. For numerical problems, rounding to the required significant figures should only be done in the final step. Numerical results must be complete; for example, tension should be expressed as a positive number, stress as a negative number, and results should be given as full numbers, not as verbal descriptions.
  For formula results, use LaTeX symbols. Pay attention to the requirements in the question and express the answer in the required format.
  The questions are constructed from exercise sets, so you need to consider possible imprecisions in the questions. For example, multi-part questions may be split into multiple samples, each with only one sub-question.
  If there is any inconsistency between the text description of the question and the information in the image, you must ignore the labels in the image and rely on the main text of the question. The information in the question is extremely important; for example, force points, whether the object is rigid or not, the direction of motion, etc., must be accurately analyzed from the question text and image. Understanding the content of the question is extremely important and must be done accurately from the question text. For example, you need to understand the direction of motion of objects in the image, as this determines the sign, which is extremely important.
  The final result must be placed within <answer>  </answer>. If the final numerical result has units, the final result must include the units.
